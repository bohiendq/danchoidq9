This provides an easy way for programs to contact hackers in order to share credentials and information regarding how to set up custom workflows without having to access their actual email address.

This enables hackers to create multiple test accounts on your program to be able to test different attack vectors on different account levels without having to create multiple HackerOne profile accounts. Hackers can use multiple email aliases through using <strong><code>[username]+[any_identifier]@wearehackerone.com</code></strong>.</p>\n<h3>FAQ</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Question</th>\n<th>Answer</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>What happens if a hacker changes their username?</td>\n<td>The email alias will automatically update with the new username.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>What happens if a hacker changes their email address on HackerOne?</td>\n<td>The emails will be forwarded to their new, correct email.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>How can I share credentials with all hackers in my program?</td>\n<td>Go to your Invitation settings (Settings > Program > Invitations) to see the list of hackers in your program.
