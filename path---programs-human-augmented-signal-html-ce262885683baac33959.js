With Human-Augmented Signal, analysts from HackerOne review reports flagged with a high noise probability by utilizing various criteria to classify all incoming reports automatically. This best-effort human review reduces the risk of false positives.  Any report dismissed by HackerOne analysts will appear in your inbox as <em>Not Applicable</em> but will not generate a notification. While eliminating all noise is improbable, Human-Augmented Signal aids in helping to provide a 90%+ signal experience for all programs.</p>\n<h3>How It Works</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>HackerOne's machine learning technology identifies reports that have a high chance of being invalid.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reports that are flagged are reviewed by a HackerOne Security Analyst. The analyst looks at these factors to determine whether a report requires review:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the hacker meet the signal requirements of the program?</li>\n<li>Did the hacker select a weakness?</li>\n<li>Does the report contain abusive language?</li>\n<li>Does the report match earlier reported issues?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If a report is determined to be invalid, it'll be closed as <strong>Not Applicable</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>HackerOne's systems are constantly improving to detect and eliminate noise across the platform.
