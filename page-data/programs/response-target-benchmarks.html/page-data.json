This will help you see what areas you need to focus on to improve your program. You can specify the kinds of programs you want to compare your program to by selecting different program requirements and creating benchmarks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This feature is currently only available for Enterprise programs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To access your response targets dashboard:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <strong>Program Dashboard > Response Targets</strong>.</li>\n<li>Select the appropriate variables for these fields:</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Field</th>\n<th>Details</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Metric</td>\n<td>What you want to measure. <br><br>You can choose from:<br><li>Median <a href=\"response-target-metrics.html\">time to resolution</a> <li>Median <a href=\"response-target-metrics.html\">time to triage</a> <li>Median <a href=\"response-target-metrics.html\">time to bounty</a> <li>Median <a href=\"response-target-metrics.html\">time to first response</a> <li>Missed resolution targets <li>Missed triage targets <li>Missed bounty targets <li>Missed first response targets <br><br><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Median</em> is the midpoint of your dataset.
