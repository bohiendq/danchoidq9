Can I integrate each of these programs to the same Jira instance?</td>\n<td>Yes, you can integrate multiple HackerOne programs to the same Jira instance. Take a look at our <a href=\"multiple-jira-integrations.html\">Setting Multiple Jira Integrations</a> article.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>My Jira is behind a firewall and is not externally accessible. How can I integrate with Jira?</td>\n<td>To use the bi-directional Jira integration, you need to make sure your Jira instance is accessible from the HackerOne system. You can allowlist HackerOneâ€™s IP addresses in your firewall to only open it up to the HackerOne application. Contact your program manager to request our IP addresses to allowlist in your firewall.<br><br>If you don't want to expose your Jira to HackerOne, <a href=\"https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/requests/new\">contact us</a> to get a work-around that enables you to only escalate to Jira.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>I'm getting the following error when creating a Jira issue: <code>JIRA returned the following error: \"You must specify a summary of the issue.\"</code></td>\n<td>This means that you didn't specify a value for the <code>summary</code> field in your Jira integration settings. Please review the field mapping in your Jira integration settings and make sure values are provided for all required fields.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Why is it that I'm using a reverse proxy and can't connect to Jira?</td>\n<td>To use the Jira integration, you need to configure Jira to allow this.

Can I restrict the integration to only specific projects/spaces?</td>\n<td>Yes, you can. The easiest way to do this is by creating a new \"h1-integration\" user that only has access to the projects you want to expose to the integration with HackerOne.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Why is that after installing the Jira Cloud add-on, Jira is giving me the following error: <code>App is not responding</code>?</td>\n<td>The plugin is trying to redirect you to HackerOne's website to finalize the setup.

If this happens, try installing the plugin with a different browser.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>How come I'm not seeing the option to create a Jira issue on the report?</td>\n<td>You can only escalate a report to Jira if you have the right permissions.
