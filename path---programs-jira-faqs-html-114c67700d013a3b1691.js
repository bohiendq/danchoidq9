Follow all of the \n<a href="jira-server-integration.html">Jira Server steps</a>\n for the first program you want to integrate.\n</ul>\n<ul>\n2. For each subsequent program you need to add an integration for, only follow steps 12-16 in \n<a href="jira-server-integration.html">the Jira Server article</a>\n.\n<ul>\n<li>\nYou only need to follow steps 12-16 because the application link has already been created when integrating with your first program, and only 1 application link is needed to set up a Jira integration.\n</li>\n</ul>\n</ul></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>My Jira is behind a firewall and is not externally accessible. How can I integrate with Jira?</td>\n<td>To use the bi-directional Jira integration, you need to make sure your Jira instance is accessible from the HackerOne system. You can whitelist HackerOneâ€™s IP addresses in your firewall to only open it up to the HackerOne application. Contact your program manager to request our IP addresses to whitelist in your firewall.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf you don\'t want to expose your Jira to HackerOne, \n<a href="https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">contact us</a>\n to get a work-around that enables you to only escalate to Jira.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>',frontmatter:{path:"/programs/jira-faqs.html",id:"programs/jira-faqs",title:"Jira FAQs",description:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
